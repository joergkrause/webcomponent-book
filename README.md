## The Mission

I'm on a mission: **We don't need fat frameworks for frontend development.**

Keep your frontend small. Keep it simple. Keep it fast. Follow the 50+50 rule.

The reason there is still a need to load some code from others is to avoid repetitive tasks. But what you need for an app depends on the requirements. Some parts are always required, some rarely. In the end it's just a bit of library code. I call this "thin libraries". Small and smart helpers. Not more. I would say that a thin library is by definition everything below 50KB compressed code. Everything else is your business code.

Let the tooling be extensive like hell. Use plug-ins and editors and whatever. But when it comes to the final delivery, the final package, the code send to the browser, than keep it small. That's the key to success. Performance is a feature. Whether it's mobile or desktop, progressive web app or Electron on a desktop. The maximum time to load, parse, and show your front page is - zero. At least it should feel like zero. To get this you need a load time of less than 50 msec.

That's the 50+50 rule. 50 KB library code, 50ms load time. Or less. Never more.

## The Library

Just to prove that's possible I have written such a thin library called **@nyaf**. It's available from **npm** and on Github. Feel free to check it out.
